              A decision support model (DSM) is a type of computer-based model
              that is designed and constructed to assist individuals or groups
              in making complex decisions. It is a tool finally that helps
              people analyze data, evaluate options, and make informed choices.
              The goal of a DSM is to provide decision-makers with the
              information and tools they need to make better decisions. This can
              involve modelling data to identify patterns or trends, simulating
              the effects of different scenarios, and providing the media to see
              the suggested actionable decision.
