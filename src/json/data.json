By operating the main method fuzzy slope and multi-stage taking into account six types of categories (i.e. electricity, water, air, building land, transportation, and waste), a DSM for evaluating the green city score was fruitfully executed. In this fuzzy slope, it is a slope calculation that will be an input for each category parameter so that you will get an output for each category in determining a green city. And this multi-stage is the various categories that are carried out in stages or one by one in each category so that when you get an output from each category, that output will become an input in determining green cities and will get a crisp output from each city or known as the green city score.",

The DSM utilizes 11 primary parameters, which include severity of harm, violence, hate, aggression, swearing terms, dominant personality, emojis, relationship, imbalance power, repetition, and visibility among peers. The severity of harm parameter is determined using the manual labeling method, while violence, hate, aggression, swearing terms, and dominant personality are analyzed using lexical analysis. The parameters of emojis, relationship, power imbalance, repetition, and visibility among peers are determined using multi-stage fuzzy logic, and each main parameter in the multi-stage fuzzy logic has sub-parameters. The model's primary objective is to distinguish between cyberbullying and banter, which can be challenging due to their close resemblance and frequent misclassification.",
