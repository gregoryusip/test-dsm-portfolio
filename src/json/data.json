The DSM utilizes 11 primary parameters, which include severity of harm, violence, hate, aggression, swearing terms, dominant personality, emojis, relationship, imbalance power, repetition, and visibility among peers. The severity of harm parameter is determined using the manual labeling method, while violence, hate, aggression, swearing terms, and dominant personality are analyzed using lexical analysis. The parameters of emojis, relationship, power imbalance, repetition, and visibility among peers are determined using multi-stage fuzzy logic, and each main parameter in the multi-stage fuzzy logic has sub-parameters. The model's primary objective is to distinguish between cyberbullying and banter, which can be challenging due to their close resemblance and frequent misclassification.",
